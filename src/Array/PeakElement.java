/*
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums,
 find a peak element, and return its index.
 If the array contains multiple peaks,
 return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
 In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly
 greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
